# Vinnovera Weather.

<b>This is a weathersite created using Apixu weather. </b>

An assignment to follow guidelines and recreate apperance/design from - https://github.com/vinnovera/arbetsprov.

Containing a searchfield to search for cities current weather. 

The city´s weather is displayed with current temperature, cityname, country and a icon (not from Apixu).
The icon images are .svg and they where changed in the svgfile to match the color of the desired design. Also the gray background grid was removed from the svgfile.

When entring the site, previously searched cities saved in localstorage will be displayed. One can remove a city div/localstorage and add more.

I made the colors of the weather divs in css (:nth-child 3n+1, 3n+2..),creating 3 diffrent colors.
I chose to do this to create a colorpattern regardless of citychoise nor actuall weather.

<b><i>Please note: [APIKEY] is not availiable in the code/ should be replaced with actuall key.</i></b>

<b>Improvements:</b>
* Icons displayed are only daytime images. A improvement would be to include nighttime icons as well with equivalent time.
* Building modules.
* Optimazation- browsers.
* Add more media queries.

<b>Choises:</b>
* I made some choises on my own. Like leaving the long shadows visible on mobileversion and adding some extra box-shadow. Purely because I feelt it was pretty. 
* I desided after talking to a fellow apprentice, to give localstorage a go, out of pure curiosity, though I just briefly touched the subject before. So the solutions for save, get, delete from localstorage might have improvements to claim. Yet I saw it as a chance to learn.

<b>Other:</b>
My thought´s after creating it
* Should of done - Mobile first and perhaps used SASS.
